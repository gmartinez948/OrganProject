The Organproject is an attempt to explore, inform and educate the American public on the disparity of minority organ donorship in the United States. We will attempt to focus on this disparity and address it by creating an interactive platform that will highlight our research but also allow us to have a wider reach.
 
The intended user is an individual interested in learning more about organ donation and the process it takes. The user will eventually be able to navigate between 3 components:
 
1) Become A Donor
2) Register As A Recipient
3) Learn Information
 
It is our hope that once our user has navigated our website he or she will be better informed on organ donation.
 
The Organproject resourced our information from the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) obtained in March 2021and April 2021.
 
 
 
The code uses the following components:
 
 
HTML and Python 3.7  and the packages: Jupyter Notebook (pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib)
CSV. Files interpreted from OPTN
