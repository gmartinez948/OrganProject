Organ Project 21'

This project is an attempt to discover the disparities of organ transplants within the Black and Latino communities.  Using the OPTN database, I have discovered that there is a disparity across many different ethnicities.  Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I have created graphs that prove this disparity.  

In the future, I will be writing an explanation for my graphs along with front end code to help bring awareness around the issue.  Also, I will be implementing a "sign up" feature that will use Python to help people sign up to potentially become a donor.  

Instructions to run the file:

When opening the OrganProject repo, please direct to the folder named "OrganProjectGraphs"

There you will find the code I used to create the graphs.
